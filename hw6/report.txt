Finish these parts 
part1. Determine for each process, which points (and thus unknowns) must be updated by which MPI tasks. 
part2. Determine which points must be communicated (i.e., the ghost nodes), and between which processors this communication must take place.

But face some problem at part3 with blocking sends and receives by allocating (Nl + 2)2 unknowns for each MPI task
The transimission of North<->South works, but the value of East<->West is incorrect and still work on it.

N=10000, process = 64, 0.616632 sec
N=100000, process = 64, 1.219925 sec
N=1000000, process = 64, 3.136984 sec

We can see that when the data size 10 times larger, the execution time only get double.
We can say that the program has good parallelize performance.
